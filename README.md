# Coffee Grams
Dial in your coffee with an IoT scale.

current stage in outline: 5

## Project Outline
1. Setup apache webserver on raspberry pi.
2. Create MySQL database with MariaDB and myPHPadmin (because GUI is nice).
3. Write Python script for inserting data into DB.
4. Create hardware prototype (hx711, loadcell, buttons?, LEDs?).
5. Create PCB for hardware in ~~Eagle~~ KiCAD.
6. Build website to display data.

## PCB/Schematic ##
The current PCB design is for an ESP32. There is currently no firmware for the ESP32 design.

I will likely be making an alternative design for use with Raspberry Pi although I currently do not have a working Pi.
